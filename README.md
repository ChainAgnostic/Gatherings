# What is this about

This repo was created as an outcome from a [session in our first gathering](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/AMS-CASA-gathering/issues/15)
It acts not only as a record and coordination repo for in person gatherings - but also as a governance process. Only events listed here can use the CASA logo and the name CASA / ChainAgnostic. Feel free to suggest events via PR though!
