# Chain Agnostic Gathering Lisbon 2022

**Date:** 27. October 2022

**Location:** Garagem Lisboa, Jardim 9 de Abril, 1200-736 Lisboa, Portugal

We will have our second CASA gathering at [Garagem](garagemlisboa.com) in Lisbon, which will be converted that week and the following into the HackerBase for IPFS Camp 2022.  This will not be a ticketed event-- simply come as you are.
